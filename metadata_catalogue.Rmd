The SCUBA data warehouse serves as a central repository for granular water use information from local water utilities in California, as well as for related contextual datasets. 

## Overview of data in SCUBA

The data include regular monthly/bimonthly billing information such as amount of water consumed, date of use, and customer classification. Some utilities also provide context such as evapotranspiration, household size and landscape area. Utility-specific customer classes have been standardized into statewide classifications aligned with the Department of Water Resources (single family residential, multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, irrigation, institutional and other). 

In many cases information is also available about which customers participated in water efficiency rebate programs like turf removal or high efficiency toilet rebates and the date of their participation. 

In addition, SCUBA enriches utility-provided data with key contextual attributes. This includes socioeconomic information from the American Community Survey (ACS), reference evapotranspiration from the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) and latitude/longitude information obtained by geocoding customer addresses.

SCUBA currently holds metered use for `r nrow(utility_geoms)` retailers, shown in the table and maps (Figures 1 & 2) below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# for (u in sort(utility_geoms$supplier_n) ){
#   cat(paste("*", u[[1]], "\n", sep = " " ))
# }

knitr::kable( as.data.frame(list("Supplier"=utility_geoms$supplier_n, "Acronym"=utility_geoms$utility_name)) )
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
m <- plot_scuba_utilities(-118, 33.7, 9)
mapshot(m, file="utilities1.png",  cliprect = c(50, 100, 900, 500))


m <- plot_scuba_utilities(-122, 38.5, 9)
mapshot(m, file="utilities2.png",  cliprect = c(150, 100, 800, 400))
```

The heatmap in Figure 3 below shows a high-level overview of water use data in SCUBA. The x-axis displays months going forward in time while the y-axis labels each utility. Color corresponds to the number of meter reads in each month, normalized for each row where dark blue to purple indicate more customers and orange to red indicate fewer. A number of data quality issues that would be of interest to researchers using SCUBA metered use data are highlighted in red text.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=20, fig.height=8}
# d3heatmap::d3heatmap(cust_counts, scale="row", Rowv=NA, Colv=NA, col=rainbow(256))
```

![Figure 3. Heatmap of customer counts over time for each utility. More detailed data quality assessments are available for approved researchers.](img/heatmap_annotated.png)


In general, most utilities have provided at least 6 years of continuous data, with some providing much more and some having less actionable data because of data quality issues. For months where all data is available, an average of $`r as.integer( round(sum(avg_counts$count, na.rm = TRUE), -3) )`$ customer accounts are represented in the data.

### Plans for Future Expansion

* More granular commercial and industrial categorizations (e.g. restaurant, hospital, church, etc.)

* Higher resolution evapotranspiration by utilizing spatial CIMIS or other future sources instead of readings directly from CIMIS stations.


### Example studies and potential questions

We are always open to creative new applications, but please see the following links for some ideas for potential questions to answer using this data.

### Data Sharing

Data may be provided at no cost to qualified researchers with explicit written permission from member utilities. If you would like to gain access to data, please complete the data access application located here:

https://goo.gl/forms/PmiBomvG68qh7je63

Access to enriched public data is relatively simple. For requests to access secure data (customer metered use) your proposal will be circulated with utility staff and you may be asked to discuss your ideas in a call or webinar with whichever of our Data Action Teams is most relvant to your proposal. Interested member utilities will provide their written consent, and you will need to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

This process is expected to take several months, after which you will be provided with data from all utilities who have given their consent. Please reach out to info@CaliforniaDataCollaborative.com with any requests.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
# ggplot(avg_counts %>% filter(!is.nan(count)) %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% mutate(utility_name = as.ordered(utility_name)), aes(utility_name, count)) + geom_col()

ggplot(avg_counts %>% filter(!is.nan(count)) %>% mutate(utility_name = as.factor(utility_name)),
       aes(x=reorder(utility_name, count, sum), y=count)
       ) +

### Water Rate Structure

The CaDC has also begun the process of collecting detailed water pricing information for utilities through California. This data us recorded using the [Open Water Rate Specification](https://github.com/California-Data-Collaborative/Open-Water-Rate-Specification) (OWRS) and is available to the public [here](https://github.com/California-Data-Collaborative/Open-Water-Rate-Specification/tree/master/full_utility_rates/California). The easiest way to analyze this data is using [RateParser](https://github.com/California-Data-Collaborative/RateParser) - a software package written in the `R` programming language that takes as input water usage data (like that stored in SCUBA) and OWRS data to calculate water bills. Using this approach is it possible to easily calculate the usage and marginal cost of water in different pricing tiers, both within and across utilities.

### Utility-level Usage Data (supplier_report)

Monthly water production for California's major urban water suppliers [obtained from](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-%E2%80%93-urban-water-supplier-monitoring-%E2%80%93-drinc) the State Water Resources Control Board. This data is then enriched with context like average evapotranspiration from nearby CIMIS stations and landscape area from the CaDC/CGU land cover data set.
